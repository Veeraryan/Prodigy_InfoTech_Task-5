In Internship at Prodigy Infotech I designed a Network Packet Analyzer Program, which collects basic network traffic data. This tool extracts three fundamental details from the packets in network which includes: Source IP, Destination IP and Protocol.

It uses packet sniffing to intercept and analyze live network traffic. This streamlines network communications through the efficient extraction of user-specified data points by parsing packet headers. It is a focused method that can immediately detect traffic trends, security vulnerabilities and network performance issues.

Both the simple nature of it, and its fast data-traffic centric properties make this a suitable tool for network engineers and security professionals who desire to quickly check traffic flow without being inundated with useless information. Lightweight to have less impact on the network performance and a lightweight X-Ray of your communication patterns.

This project helped me to develop things like network programming, data parsing, and cybersecurity along with practical experience in tools development for network analysis/monitoring.
